\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  The classical Fubini's theorem for Lebesgue integrals and product
  measures seems to depend on forbidden arithmetics (e.g. $\infty -
  \infty$) on infinities as extended real numbers.
\end{abstract}

There's no way to prevent their uses such that whenever they were
used, the proof cannot proceed. And sometimes they were subtlely
without being noticed by the proof writer.
